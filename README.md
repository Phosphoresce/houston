Houston is an attempt at a high speed low drag client-side load balancer.

Documentation
-------------

This is it.

Getting Started
---------------

Houston is designed to run within a very minimal docker container so all you need to get started is [Docker](https://www.docker.com).  

Once you have docker installed simply pull the image.  

```sh
$ docker pull phosphoresce/houston
```

Houston shouldn't require anything special to start. Maybe an instance roll with permissions?

```sh
$ docker run phosphoresce/houston
```

Thats pretty much it so far!
